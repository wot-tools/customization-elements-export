# Customization Elements Export

This mod will output all customization elements in a .csv file. The column "\_boundVehicles" should be the most interesting, this can be used to find old CW camos that are already bound to vehicles. Be sure to understand that each vehicle gets its own line, so if you open the file in excel be sure to expand the rows.

# Installation

1. Take the .pyc file from releases and put it in World_of_Tanks_EU\res_mods\1.16.0.0\scripts\client\gui\mods
2. Start the game and log in
3. As soon as the garage loaded, there should be a notification that the .csv was written in the wot notifications in-game
4. The .csv file can be found in your WoT folder

This mod should work with future version after 1.16.0.0
